# Containerized Internet Monitor with Dash & Tapo Power Cycling

[](https://www.python.org/)

[](https://dash.plotly.com/)

This project provides a self-contained, easy-to-deploy solution for monitoring your internet connectivity. It periodically pings external targets, logs the results to an SQLite database, and visualizes the data on a web dashboard.

If the connection is down for a sustained period, it can **automatically power cycle your modem/router** using a TP-Link Tapo smart plug. The entire system is packaged into a single Docker container, making setup incredibly simple.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **üìä Interactive Web Dashboard:** Visualize internet health with real-time graphs for uptime, latency, and packet loss using a Plotly Dash interface.
  * **ü§ñ Automated Power Cycling:** Automatically reboots your modem via a Tapo P100 smart plug after 5 consecutive failed checks.
  * **üëÜ Manual Override:** A "Restart NBN" button on the dashboard allows you to trigger a power cycle manually at any time.
  * **üöÄ Simple Docker Setup:** Get up and running with a single `docker-compose up` command. No need to manually install any dependencies.
  * **üóÑÔ∏è SQLite Logging:** All connectivity data is logged to an SQLite database within the container.

## üöÄ Quickstart

Getting the monitor running is simple. You just need Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 2\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/famesjranko/network-monitoring-dashboard.git
cd network-monitoring-dashboard
```

### 3. Configure Docker Compose

To customize monitoring behavior or enable TP-Link Tapo smart plug control, open the `docker-compose.yml` file and uncomment the `environment` section. Then fill in the values as needed:

```yaml
services:
  local-network-monitor:
    image: network-monitor:latest
    build: .
    container_name: local-network-monitor
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8050:8050"
    environment:
      - DISPLAY_TZ=Australia/Melbourne # where you are
      - DB_PATH=/app/logs/internet_status.db
      - RETENTION_DAYS=14
      - VACUUM_INTERVAL_RUNS=720   # ~12h if check runs every minute
      # Comma-separated list of IPs to ping for internet connectivity checks
      # - Defaults to 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1,9.9.9.9 if not set
      # - Example: 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1
      # - INTERNET_CHECK_TARGETS=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1,9.9.9.9

      # Tapo credentials and device details for controlling the smart plug
      # - TAPO_EMAIL=
      # - TAPO_PASSWORD=
      # - TAPO_DEVICE_IP=
      # - TAPO_DEVICE_NAME=""

      # Cooldown period in seconds between allowed modem reboots (via smart plug)
      # Prevents repeated power cycles within a short period.
      # - Example: 3600 (1 hour)
      # - TAPO_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=3600

      # Number of consecutive failed checks before triggering power cycle
      # - Default: 5
      # - Example: FAILURE_THRESHOLD=3
      # - FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
```

**Notes:**

* `INTERNET_CHECK_TARGETS` and `FAILURE_THRESHOLD` work independently of Tapo and are always respected.
* `RETENTION_DAYS` limits how long records are kept for
* `VACUUM_INTERVAL_RUNS` how often db vacuuming is run
* `DISPLAY_TZ` can set local time for dashboard or leave unset for UTC
* If you're **not using a Tapo smart plug**, just leave the Tapo-related variables commented out.
* It's recommended to assign a **static IP address** to your Tapo plug via your router's DHCP settings to ensure stable communication.

### 4\. Build and Run the Container

From the project's root directory, launch the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 5\. Access the Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to:

**`http://localhost:8050`**

(Replace `localhost` with the IP address of your host machine if you're accessing it from another device on your network).

-----

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

This project runs within a **single, all-in-one Docker container**.

The `Dockerfile` builds an image based on Python 3.8 and installs all necessary components: `ping`, `sqlite3`, the `redis-server`, and `supervisor`.

Inside the container, `supervisord` is responsible for running and managing three key processes simultaneously:

1.  **Redis Server:** A local Redis instance for caching dashboard data.
2.  **Monitoring Script (`check_internet.sh`):** A shell script that runs every minute to ping targets and log results.
3.  **Dash Web App (`internet_status_dashboard.py`):** A Gunicorn server that hosts the Python web application.

This single-container approach simplifies deployment and management.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

These variables can be set in your `docker-compose.yml` file to customize monitoring behavior and enable automated power cycling. Tapo-related variables are optional ‚Äî if not set or invalid, the **"Restart NBN"** button will be disabled and automatic power cycling will be skipped.

| Variable                 | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INTERNET_CHECK_TARGETS` | Comma-separated list of IPs to ping. Default: `8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1,9.9.9.9`. Works without Tapo. |
| `FAILURE_THRESHOLD`      | Number of consecutive failed checks required to trigger a power cycle. Default: `5`.         |
| `TAPO_EMAIL`             | **Optional.** Your Tapo account email (used for smart plug control).                         |
| `TAPO_PASSWORD`          | **Optional.** Your Tapo account password.                                                    |
| `TAPO_DEVICE_IP`         | **Optional.** Static IP address of your Tapo plug (recommended to reserve via DHCP).         |
| `TAPO_DEVICE_NAME`       | **Optional.** Friendly display name for your smart plug device (used in logs and UI).        |
| `TAPO_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`  | **Optional.** Cooldown (in seconds) between allowed modem reboots. Default: `3600` (1 hour). |
| `RETENTION_DAYS`         | limits how long records are kept for                                                         |
* `VACUUM_INTERVAL_RUNS`   | how often db vacuuming is run                                                                |
* `DISPLAY_TZ`             | **Optional.** can set local time for dashboard or leave unset for UTC                        |

> üí° `INTERNET_CHECK_TARGETS` is obviously used even if you're not using a Tapo plug.
